1)Variable Length Argument List (Varargs)
  Varargs stands for "Variable Arguments". It allows you to pass multiple values (or even none) to a method using a single parameter.
Instead of writing several overloaded methods or passing an array manually, Java lets you do this more easily with varargs.

Purpose: Allows a method to accept zero or more arguments of the same type.
Introduced in Java 5 to simplify methods that take multiple arguments.

Syntax : returnType methodName(type... varName)

-The ... (three dots) tells Java it's a varargs parameter.
-Internally, Java treats varargs as an array.

✅ Key Points:
-You can pass any number of arguments (even zero).

-Only one varargs parameter is allowed per method.

-It must be the last parameter in the method signature.


2)Command Line Arguments
    These are arguments passed to the main() method from the command line.Command Line Arguments are values passed 
to a Java program when it starts, from the command line (terminal/console).
These values go into the main method as a String array.
Signature: public static void main(String[] args)

args is an array of String values.

✅ Key Points:
-args is an array of Strings.

-You can pass any number of arguments (even zero).

-Arguments are always Strings, so you may need to convert them if needed (e.g., to int).
